# Overview

Our project aims to tackle the critical issue of waste mismanagement through WasteWizard, an AI consumer app that leverages computer vision to enable users to upload images of waste and receive information on their appropriate waste categories and disposal methods. With the US recycling rate at just 32% (EPA 2018), optimizing waste sorting is urgent. WasteWizard accurately categorizes images of waste into 26 sub-categories of recyclables, e-waste, and hazardous materials, reducing reliance on manual labor and minimizing waste contamination. Ultimately, this innovation promises to empower users with clear waste sorting guidance, enhance recycling efficiency, decrease landfill overflow, and mitigate environmental hazards associated with improper waste disposal.
